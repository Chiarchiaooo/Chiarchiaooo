## Hello there! 👋

I'm Luke, an IT student passionate about technology and coding. <br>Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I’m based in Switzerland and I enjoy tinkering with tech — modding things, customizing setups, and seeing how far I can push them. As an CS student, I like working on projects that let me experiment and make things truly my own.<br>I've found out that works really well for developing problem-solving skills (Torvalds was right about Git btw).
<br><br>
Another particular field of interest for me is: Social Engineering, since even best, most secure and reliable code on the planet is bound to fail to Human nature. Last but not least, Foreign Languages, hoping to reach fluency in at least 5 languages, counting also my native.
